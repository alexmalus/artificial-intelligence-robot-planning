Hey guys. The code committed is setup for an IntelliJ environment on a Mac.
In order to run this project you need to edit your run configurations.

First of all you need to set the source folder to src in this project, and hopefully your IDE
will acknowledge I have added server.jar as apart of the project. If your IDE does not recognize that
then you need to do that manually.
Once that is done, make sure you set the run configuration to run the main method
in server.runner class in server.jar.
Once that is done, then I think you only then need to paste these program arguments in as well:
-l levels/MAsimple1.lvl -c "java -cp ../out/production/AI_Ateam client.ateam.Main" -g

It is important to emphasize that you need to point to the binary directory where you
will find the class files of your compiled project. Have fun! :-)
